## Test your Cloud Connect-compatible FHIR server

If you are planning to connect your EHR/EMR with Ocean via Cloud Connect, start by consulting the [Ocean Cloud Connect FHIR Implementation Guide](<[https://](https://simplifier.net/ocean-cloud-connect-fhir-implementation-guide)>).

The best way to test your Cloud Connect FHIR server is to use Cloud Connect itself, by setting up a Cloud Connect integration in the Cloud Connect portal. However, it may be difficult to troubleshoot issues in the early stages of development, so this module can be used in the early stages of development to test the basic authorization and data exchange protocols. It may also serve as a useful starting point for an integration test suite for your EHR/EMR.
